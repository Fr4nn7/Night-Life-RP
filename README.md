# Disclaimes: 

The RAID storage of the server is directly uploaded from the VPS. It's crucial not to modify the CFG. If you intend to use any resource from here, remember to provide proper credits to the authors.
If you're running the server on LocalHost, you need to update the API Keys. Otherwise, the machine's subsystem won't initiate. You can obtain the keys on the official FiveM webpage.

Initiating the database with the SQL is extremely important before starting the machine for the first time. Initialization is done by uploading the SQL file to Apache or Heidi. Failing to do so will result in automatic creation of relevant files, causing translation and interpretation errors.

Without a Platinum Key, you won't be able to view Assets or ADD-ONs on a VPS or dedicated server. However, this restriction doesn't apply if you run it on LocalHost, as no license is required for that.
Changing folder names will disrupt the resource search system. This setup preserves the authors originality and their use by third parties.

The server utilizes three types of dependencies:

Frameworks: Cfx.re, ESX
SQL: DB Data
Auth: Steam API

Without this information, initiation is impossible. Any alteration to it will break the subsystem.
